## Intro to Web Apps with Flask
Flask is a Python web micro-framework. In this course, we'll create fully-featured web apps with Flask.

## What is the back-end?
### Storing Data
The back-ends of websites typically include a database to store information. Relational databases store info in tables. Non-relational aka NoSQL databases use other systems like key-value pairs or a document storage model. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language for relational databases. Examples of relational databases are MySQL & Postgres. Examples of NoSQL databases are MongoDB & Redis.

The back-end needs the ability to access, change, and analyze database data

### What's an API?
API stands for Application Program Interface. To have consistent ways of interacting with data, a back-end can use a web API. 

A web API is a collection of predefined ways of interacting with a web application's data, often through a HTTP request-response cycle. Unlike the HTTP request from client to server when a url load, this type of request indicates how it would like to interact with a web app's data, and it receives some data back as a response.

Database  <——> Web API (CRUD)

CRUD — Create new data, read data, update data, delete data)

Some APIs are open to the public.

### Authorization & Authentication
Our server shall handle this.

**Authentication** is the process of validating the identity of a user. "Who is this? Is it really you?" One example is usernames/passwords as credentials stored in the back-ends database. We can also use external log-in resources such as logging in with Google.

**Authorization** dictates which users have access to which resources and actions. "What is this user allowed to see/do?" Think of admin-access vs. intern-access.

Our back-end needs Authentication & Authorization in our server-side logic to create *secure, personalized, & dynamic* content.
