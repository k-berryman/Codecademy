### What is the back-end?
#### Storing Data
The back-ends of websites typically include a database to store information. Relational databases store info in tables. Non-relational aka NoSQL databases use other systems like key-value pairs or a document storage model. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language for relational databases. Examples of relational databases are MySQL & Postgres. Examples of NoSQL databases are MongoDB & Redis.

The back-end needs the ability to access, change, and analyze database data

#### What's an API?
API stands for Application Program Interface. To have consistent ways of interacting with data, a back-end can use a web API. A web API is a collection of predefined ways of interacting with a web application's data, often through HTTP requests/responses.
